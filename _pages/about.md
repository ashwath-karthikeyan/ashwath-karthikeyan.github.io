#### Hey there! I'm Ashwath Karthikeyan.

I'm a grad student at UIUC, pursuing my Master's in Robotics. My expertise spans control systems, robot navigation, and state estimation techniques, honed through coursework, academic projects, international collegiate robotics competitions and a systems engineering internship at Stellantis, a global leader in the automotive industry. This blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience, combined with a passion for robotics, drives my ambition to contribute to groundbreaking projects in the field.

My academic projects have allowed me to experiment with and understand the complexities of autonomous vehicles, mobile robots for competitions, as well as the dynamics of legged robots and manipulators. I'm also familiar with Agile and Scrum methodologies and have used Kanban boards to keep projects on track, blending organizational skills with technical know-how.

To me, robotics transcends being a figment of science fiction. It is real technology we can put to use; it represents a powerful tool for addressing real-world challenges, undertaking repetitive or hazardous tasks and employing human intellect and creativity for more complex and innovative endeavors.

As I enter this amazing field full of potential and promise, I’m looking for opportunities to apply my technical skills in robotics and contribute to a team that’s passionate about innovation and impact. As someone at the beginning of their career, I bring fresh ideas, boundless energy, and a readiness to dive into any project where I can learn, contribute, and help create something amazing.
