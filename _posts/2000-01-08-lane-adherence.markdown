This project requires mainly three modules : Perception (camera feed), Planning (middle line generation), Control (vehicle velocity and steering wheel angle)

Perception : Take in live camera feed, apply perspective transform, detect left and right lanes.

Planning : Based on detected lanes, draw middle lane based on the pixel values, and generate waypoint from the pixel values.

Control : Control velocity to be at a set 5 mph speed, and control steering angle to maintain car on the planned path.
