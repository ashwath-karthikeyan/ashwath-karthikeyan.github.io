## State Estimation with Extended Kalman Filter

State estimation is an important technique, used in fields such as robotics and aerospace where true system states are often obscured or indirectly observed through noisy sensors. Techniques like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are employed to infer these hidden states. EKF extends the basic concept of a Kalman Filter to nonlinear systems by linearizing around the current estimate at each timestep.

In EKF, the process begins with a prediction step using a predefined mathematical model of the system dynamics, which estimates the state forward in time. This model is typically represented as a program of differential equations.

Then, the update step adjusts this prediction based on new sensor measurements. The relationship between the measured values and the system states is defined by a measurement model, which like the system model, can be nonlinear and is linearized in the context of EKF.

Both the system and measurement models are subject to uncertainties. EKF addresses this by assuming that both the process and measurement noises are Gaussian, which simplifies the computation of the Kalman gainâ€”a factor that determines the weighting of the new measurement relative to the prediction.

#### Problem statement

Let us now imagine that we have an autonomous vehicle, represented by the Dubins Car Model. This can be written as a system with a state vector given by

$$x = \begin{bmatrix}p_x \\p_y\\ \theta \\ v \\ \phi \end{bmatrix}$$

and a transition vector given by

$$\dot x= f(x,u) =\begin{bmatrix} \dot p_x \\ \dot p_y\\ \dot \theta \\ \dot v\\ \dot \phi\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v\ cos(\theta) \\v\ sin(\theta)\\\frac{v}{L}tan(\phi)\\a\\ \psi\end{bmatrix}.$$

We want to control the car's motion in its configuration space with the help of the control vector given by

$$u = \begin{bmatrix}a \\ \psi \end{bmatrix}.$$

The issue is that we do not have a direct reading of its state space. Instead we have a GPS sensor that can calculate the car's forward velocity $v$, the heading rate $\dot \theta$, and the global coordinates $(g_x, g_y)$. The GPS sensor is located at point $(g_x^{ref}, g_y^{ref})$ in the ego frame.

However, on testing, we find out that there are errors in the dynamics model. This is to be expected, since Dubins Car is only a theoretical model of a real vehicle's dynamics, and theory will only take you so far. 

The results of testing give us reason to believe that 

1. Due to physical issues with the acceleration pedal, the set acceleration $a$ has an error of standard deviation $\lvert a \rvert \cdot \sigma_a$.

2. There is an error in the steering angle, $\phi$, causing the heading $\theta$ to deviate, especially at high speeds. This error has the standard deviation $\lvert v \rvert \cdot \sigma_\theta$.

3. The vehicle's position slips occassionally, and the velocity error in the forward direction is estimated to have a standard deviation $\lvert v \rvert \cdot \sigma_{fwd}$ and the error in the sideways direction has an SD of $ \lvert v \rvert \cdot \ \sigma_{side}$.

We also discover during testing that there are noises in the GPS sensor's observation

1. The magnitude of error in velocity increases with velocity, and the standard deviation is given by $\lvert v \rvert \cdot \sigma_v$.

2. Heading rate measurement has errors with SD $\sigma _{\dot \theta}$

3. Both $x$ and $y$ direction readings have errors with SD $\sigma_g$

Let's now see how we can solve this
